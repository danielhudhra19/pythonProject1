This is our simple "Connect 4" project in "Applied System Software" course. So, welcome to our implementation of the classic Connect 4 game! 
This project brings the timeless two-player strategy game to life with a vibrant graphical interface, 
allowing players to challenge each other in a bid to connect four pieces in a row.

Connect 4 is a two-player connection game in which the players take turns dropping colored discs from the top into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. 
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. 
The game ends when one player achieves this goal or when the grid is completely filled without any player forming such a line, resulting in a draw.

---Features---
User-Friendly Interface: A colorful and intuitive GUI built with Tkinter that makes gameplay engaging and easy to follow.
Dynamic Gameplay: Players can click on the columns to drop their pieces, with the game automatically updating to reflect the current state.
Winning Detection: The game accurately detects horizontal, vertical, and diagonal wins, declaring the winner and preventing further moves once the game is over.
Restart and New Game Options: Easily restart the current game or start a new one at any time through the in-game menu.

---How to Play---
1) Start the Game: Launch the game and the interface will display the game board along with buttons for each column.
2) Make a Move: Player 1 (Red) starts by clicking a button above the desired column to drop a red piece. Player 2 (Yellow) follows by dropping a yellow piece.
3) Alternate Turns: Players take turns dropping pieces until one player connects four pieces in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or the board is full.
4) Winning the Game: The game will automatically detect a win or draw and announce the result. Players can choose to restart or start a new game using the menu options.
